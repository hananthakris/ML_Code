REGRESSION

- Building and running my own versions of various regression methods in Machine Learning. 
- Using the real time datasets provided to understand Error and Loss functions.

CLASSIFICATION
- Building and running simple classifier models such as Logistic Regression and K Nearest Neighbors from scratch
- Testing these methods out on Kaggle Data
- Coding up a Neural Network from scratch, including writing its Loss functions.
- Using Autograd to compute gradients and make predictions out of the Neural Network
